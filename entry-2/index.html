        In this collection, the first topic, "How to relieve stress effectively," addresses how people nowadays face a lot of stress in their lives due to various factors. Through this topic, I aim to provide people with simple and effective ways to reduce stress. So, I will introduce several methods to reduce stress, displaying only the keywords on the website initially. When users click on these keywords, detailed explanations will be provided.
        The next topic is "Songs that are good to listen to while working out." I usually enjoy exercising while listening to music. I find that my choice of music varies depending on my mood, and searching for suitable songs every time can be quite challenging. Therefore, I want to create a website where users can easily access different playlists based on their mood for that day.
        The final topic is "Healthy habits." I want to present easily understandable information about common healthy habits that people can incorporate into their daily lives. Health is a trending topic nowadays, and given our busy routines, people need straightforward and accessible information on adopting healthy habits. I plan to create a website with icons or keywords that users can click on to access detailed information.
