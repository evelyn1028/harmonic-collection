        Physical Health: Sleep and rest play a crucial role in physical health. During rest, the body undergoes repair and maintenance processes. This includes tissue growth and repair, immune system support, and the release of hormones that regulate growth, stress, and appetite. Without adequate rest, these processes can be disrupted, leading to health issues.
